<b>About</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>"I developed a responsive clone of the Sundown Studios official website using HTML, CSS, and GSAP. This project involved meticulously replicating the design and functionality of the original site while ensuring it was fully responsive across different devices.
<br>
<br>
 GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) enabled me to create high-performance, smooth animations with precise control over sequences, enhancing the user experience with dynamic visual effects.
 <br>
 <br>
 This project demonstrates my ability to implement advanced animation techniques and build interactive, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive web pages."</p>
